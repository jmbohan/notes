# Agile vs Traditional

Traditional
: Having the entire plan laid out from start to finish for a project or program

Agile
: Smaller projects or functional modules (minimal viable project) to concentrate on rather than the project as a whole

Project
: Has a start and an end for a product

Repriortisation
: finding the procedures that are the most important at the current moment

| Traditional                             |                       Agile                       |
| :-------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------------------------: |
| Complete Solutions                      |                Functional Modules                 |
| Linear Development                      |                 Short Iterations                  |
| Lock Down Change                        | Experimentation, Improvement and repriortisation  |
| Users specify all requirements to start |       Users embedded throughout the process       |
