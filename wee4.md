# Agile vs Traditional 

Traditional 
: Having the entire plan laid out from start to finish for a project or program 

Agile
: Smaller projects or functional modules (minamil viable project) to concentrate on rather than the project as a whole 

Project
: Has a start and an end for a product 

repriortisation 
: finding the procedures that are the most important at the current moment
